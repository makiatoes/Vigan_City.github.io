            <h2> Vigan City: UNESCO World Heritage City</h2>
    
            <p>Vigan is the most intact example in Asia of a planned Spanish colonial town, established in the 16th century. 
                Its architecture reflects the coming together of cultural elements from elsewhere in the Philippines and from 
                China with those of Europe and Mexico to create a unique culture and townscape without parallels anywhere in 
                East and South-East Asia. An important trading post before the colonial era, Vigan is located at the river 
                delta of Abra River, along the northwestern coastline of the main island of Luzon, in the Province of Ilocos 
                Sur, Philippine Archipelago. The total area of the inscribed property is 17.25 hectares. The traditional Hispanic 
                checkerboard street plan opens up into two adjacent plazas. The Plaza Salcedo is the longer arm of an L-shaped 
                open space, with the Plaza Burgos as the shorter. The two plazas are dominated by the St. Paul’s Cathedral, the 
                Archbishop’s Palace, the City Hall and the Provincial Capitol Building . The urban plan of the town closely 
                conforms with the Renaissance grid plan specified in the Ley de la Indias for all new towns in the Spanish Empire.
                There is, however, a noticeable difference between Vigan and contemporary Spanish colonial towns in Latin America 
                in the Historic Core (known as the Mestizo district), where the Latin tradition is tempered by strong Chinese, 
                Ilocano, and Filipino influences. As its name implies, this district was settled by affluent families of mixed 
                Chinese-Ilocano origin. The area contains the historic footprint of the entire town and consists of a total of 
                233historic buildings tightly strung along a grid of 25 streets.</p>
