                        excellent place to shop for souvenir items, antiques and furniture. Lies along the streets of Calle 
                        Crisologo are hotels, restaurants and coffee shops. It is the best place to ride a Calesa.

                    <h2>Villa Angela</h2>
                    <p>Villa Angela Heritage House located along Quirino Blvd., is a typical ancestral house constructed in 
                        Vigan in the 1800s. Agapito B. Florendo, a gobernadorcillo, had it built in 1870. The house itself 
                        is part of a 2,000 square meter property owned by the prominent Versoza family. They named it after 
                        their matriarch, Angela Versoza VilÂ¬lanueva. The property was restored by descendants in the eighties. 
                        It has since then become a depository of the mementos acquired by the family from the earliest years onwards, 
                        which they proudly share with their visitors</p>
