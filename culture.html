                    <p>The Ilocano term for molding. This terra-cotta or red-clay craft is one of the traditional industries that 
                        Vigan is known for. It has existed since the 19th century and is still done in homes within several of Vigan's barangays. 
                        Local and foreign visitors who wish to see how this craft is done may visit the barangays of Ayusan Sur, Barraca, Bulala, 
                        Paratong, Paoa, Pong-ol and Salindeg. Of these barangays, Bulala is most known for damili-making and, therefore, most visited.</p>
